# NGPCEdit
Tile editor for the NGPC.

With the bitmap import feature (only supports 8-bit greyscale bitmaps as of 1.0), you can trick your friends and family into thinking that you're good at pixel art and didn't just download a pic off of Pixiv (still gotta add the color yourself, took me like an hour for the below pic).
